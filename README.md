Hi. This is my portfolio, created in Next.js. I demonstrate full-stack web development with PostgreSQL, which is used to create a feature that allows you to leave me a note. I also use Sanity.io as a backend CMS to store my projects and fetch them for display using the server-side rendering feature of Next.js. Additionally, I use Tailwind CSS to style it, making it aesthetically pleasing.
